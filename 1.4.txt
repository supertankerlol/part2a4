(function () { 
	try { 
		throw new Error(); 
	} catch (x) { 
		var x = 1, y = 2; 
		console.log(x); 
	} 
	
	console.log(x); 
	console.log(y);
})();

output:
    1
    undefined
    2

console.log(x) inside the catch block logs the locally declared x, which is 1.

Outside of the catch block, you attempt to log x. Since there's a variable x declared within the function scope but it hasn't been assigned a value, it logs undefined.

You also attempt to log y outside of the catch block. The variable y was declared within the function scope and is accessible both inside and outside the catch block, so it logs 2.
